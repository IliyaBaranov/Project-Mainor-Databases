# Automated Car Inventory System

## Project Description

The project aims to develop an automated car inventory system for dealerships. The system provides the following functionalities:

- Manage car records with the ability to add, edit, and delete entries.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for managing and filtering information.
- Store and manage data on employees and cars.
- Implement user authentication using password hashing.

## Advantages

- Accelerates the car selection process for clients.
- Automates data management and reduces employee workload.
- Enhances the accuracy of inventory tracking and customer service.
- Fully integrates with the dealershipâ€™s local database.

## Technology Stack

- **Database**: SQLite
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `hashlib` (password hashing)
  - `sqlite3` (SQLite database interaction)
  - `PyQt5` (GUI creation)
  - `json` (JSON data handling)

## Database Structure

   - `year_from` (INTEGER)
   - `year_to` (INTEGER)
   - `body_type` (TEXT)
   - `mark_id` (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY)

3. **Generations (Model Generations):**
   - `id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY)
   - `name` (TEXT)
   - `year_start` (INTEGER)
   - `year_stop` (INTEGER)
   - `model_id` (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY)

4. **Specifications (Car Specifications):**

   - `horse_power` (INTEGER)
   - `transmission` (TEXT)
   - `drive` (TEXT)
   - `volume` (REAL)
   - `consumption_mixed` (REAL)
   - `max_speed` (INTEGER)
   - `price` (REAL)
   - `model_id` (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY)

5. **Employees (Dealership Employees):**
   - `id` (INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY)
   - `name` (TEXT)
   - `login` (TEXT)
   - `password` (TEXT, hashed)

## Installation

1. Install Python version 3.8 or higher.
2. Install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the script to initialize the database.

## Features
